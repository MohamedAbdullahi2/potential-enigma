# Nodejs project:- A Command Line To Generate Peofessional README

I have used node.js and npm  the inquirer package and the starter code fork respo  https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma
I write a command-line programme that prompts users and creates a README for their projects in a polished manner. Actually, the  nodejs ReadmMe generator was used to create this project. Try it out and take comfort in knowing that your README needs are all taken care of.

To create a professional Readme file, follow the instructions below if you want to add something. [walkthrough video.](https://www.loom.com/share/63af8e3b9cc34d70ae61459e88d96083)
